PART 1:
AIM: Use Deep neural network (ANN) to perform regression and classification of  signals into target values/classes.
Jupyter NB: NeuralNetwork_SignalStrength 
Dataset: Signal.csv

Actions perform:

1.Basic EDA
2.Check for distribution of data
3.Perform feature engineering/ feature selection.
4.Split into dependent/ independent variables. Split into train-test sets
6.Build a Neural network using optimisers, layers, weight initialisers, losses etc.  train and tune  the model to achieve best performance.
  Similarly build another ANN to perform regression.
7.Compare the performances of models. Save the models for future use.



PART 2:
AIM: Use Deep neural network (ANN) to recognize digits in the images using SVHN (Street View Housing Number ) dataset.
Jupyter NB: SVHN_NeuralNetworkClassifier
Dataset: Autonomous_Vehicles_SVHN_single_grey1.h5

Actions perform:

1.Basic EDA
2.Data Visualisation
3.Reshaping the datasets.
4.Data Normalization
5.One hot coding the target column
6.Split into dependent/ independent variables. Split into train-test sets
7.Create Neural Network model. Train and tune the model using keras-tuner to get the best accuracy.
