    "### OBSERVATIONS/CONCLUSIONS:\n",
    "1. For the IMDB dataset containing word indices for reviews, we were able to reverse and get the words using get_word_index function. We have analysed the distribution for sentiment column which seems to be fairly distributed among the two classes.We have designed, trained and tuned Sequential LSTM model using combinations of hyperparameters. The input feature to this model is the word indices from dataset with padding sequences.\n",
    "2. The model has achieved accuracy of 86.96 % or close to 87%.\n",
    "3. Out of 20 predicted values, the model is able to predict 19 sentiment values correctly."
