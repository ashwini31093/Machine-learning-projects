PART 1:

AIM: Identify and classify the plant seedlings into categories using Convolutional neural network models.
Jupyter NB: Plant_Seedling_Identification_CNN

Actions perform:
1.Basic EDA
2.Analyse the dimensions of the data. Visualise the data
3. Train tune and test AIML image classifier model using:
    Use supervised learning algorithms for training
    Use neural networks for training
    Use CNN for training
4.Compare the results from the above steps.
5.Pickle the best performing model


PART 2:
AIM :Task is to build the image dataset to be used by the AI team to build an image classifier . Import and display the images in python against their labels.
Jupyter NB: Cars_Dataset

PART 3:
AIM: Classify the flowers into their categories using CNN and transfer learning.

Jupyter NB: FlowerSpecis_CNN
Actions perform:

1.analyse the dimension of data.
2.Preprocess the data
3. Data visualisation
4.Train tune and test AIML image classifier model using:
  • Supervised learning algorithms for training
  • Use neural networks for training
  • Use CNN for training
  • Use various CNN with transferred learning models for training
4.Compare the results from the above steps.
