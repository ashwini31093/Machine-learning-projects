AIM: Diagnose Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data using Ensemble models like Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Bagging Classifier and Stacking. Aim is to demonstrate the performance of ensembled models in certain case of datasets.

Jupyter NB: Ensembletechnique_ParkinsonDieaseDetection_Solution
Dataset: Data - Parkinsons.csv

Actions perform:

1. Basic EDA
2. Check for distribution of data
3. Perform feature engineering/ feature selection.
4. Split into dependent/ independent variables. Split into train-test sets
5.Fit the models individual ML models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes , SVM and KNN on train set and check the performance using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve and PR curve.
6.Fit the models ensembled ML models like Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Bagging Classifier and Stacking on train set and check the performance using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve and PR curve.
7. Compare the performance of models in step 5 and step 6.
8. Pick the model with best performance.
9.Predict and print result using the best model.
