Actions perform:
1. Basic EDA
2. Check for distribution of data
3. Perform feature engineering/ feature selection.
4. Split into dependent/ independent variables. Split into train-test sets
5. Fit the models on train set and check the performance using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve and PR curve.
6. Pick the model with best performance.
7. Predict and print result using the best model.
